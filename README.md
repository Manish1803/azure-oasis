# 🏡 Azure Oasis – Full Stack Hotel Booking Platform

**Azure Oasis** is a full-stack application built for a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins. It consists of two main parts:

1. 🌐 **Customer-Facing Website** – where guests can learn about the hotel, browse available cabins, make reservations, and manage their profiles.
2. 🛠️ **Internal Hotel Management System** – used by hotel staff to manage bookings, guest information, and cabins.
